Method Development for Predicting Protein Subcellular Localization Based on Deep Learning


# PSL_DA
Aiming at the problem of large amount of unlabeled data in current protein database, a prediction method of protein subcellular localization based on conditional antagonistic network domain adaptation was studied. Firstly, the source domain data and the target domain data are defined, and then the common feature representation between the data in different domains is learned according to the network model. Finally, the unmarked target domain sequence data is predicted according to the training results of the source domain data.
